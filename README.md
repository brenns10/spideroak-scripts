SpiderOak Scripts
=================

This is a Python module and a script for working with SpiderOak.  The module
mostly deals with getting file and folder revision history.  File history is
available on the GUI, and the CLI provides history, but not just for a single
file.  The script uses these functions to try to fix a problem I'm having with
SpiderOak.

In order to use the module, you'll need to exit out of SpiderOak.  Otherwise,
every shell-out to SpiderOak will fail.
